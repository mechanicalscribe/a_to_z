Typography displays typically require sentences that use every letter in the English alphabet. The most canonical of these is "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog." Google Fonts uses "Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil Queen and Jack."

This simple browser game invites you to create your own sentences that use every letter while remaining as succinct as possible.

# Word validation
The game only allows words that are in the ```2od12inf.txt``` list in [Kevin's Word List](http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/). The lookup algorithm, which uses a trie structure, comes courtesy of [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/blog/revised-javascript-dictionary-search/).
